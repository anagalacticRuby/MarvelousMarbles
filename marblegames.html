    <h1>Marble Games</h1>
    <p>

    <h3>Types of Marble Games</h3>
    <p>
      Now that you know some useful marble terms, take a look at some types of
      games you can play with marbles! Note that this list is not
      comprehensive, and there are plenty more games than just the ones listed
      here.
    </p>
    <h4>Ringer (or Ring Taw)</h4>
    <div>
      <p>
        RINGER is played in a ring ten (10) feet in diameter, with thirteen
        (13) marbles arranged in the center of a cross. The object is to shoot
        these marbles out of the ring. The player shooting the largest number
        of marbles out of the ring in any game is the winner of that game. No
        less than two and no more than six can play in one game, except that
        in the final championship matches only two play. In preliminary
        eliminations as many as six may play in one game. All play is for fair
        and marbles must be returned to the referee after each game. You can
        read more about the rules of Ringer at

          src="imgs/ringerdiagram.jfif" alt="Diagram of a Ringer circle" />
      </p>
    </div>
    <h5>Cherry Pit</h5>
    <p>
      Cherry pit is a reverse variant of Ring Taw. A hole is dug in the center
      of a ringer circle before play begins. Each player places a number of
      marbles around the hole so that there is about a dozen marbles
      surrounding the hole. Players take turns trying to knock marbles into
      the hole. Like Ring Taw, as long as marbles are knocked into the hole
      and the taw remains in the ring, players may continue to shoot. If a taw
      goes into the hole, the owner must forfeit a number of marbles and place
      them around the hole to 'buy back' his shooter.

    <h5>Tournament Play</h5>
    <p>
      Ringer is the preferred game for tournament play, from tournaments like
      the National Marbles Tournament in Wildwood New Jersey. It is also
      played at the British and World Championship, which is an international
      tournament that has team style play. 49 ducks are placed in the center
      of the ring, and mibsters shoot into the group with a "tolley" (British
      slang for shooter) and fight to be the first team to score 25 points.

    <h4>Hundreds</h4>
    <p>
      A game for two players. Draw a small circle or make a small hole a
      suitable distance from the shooting spot. Both players shoot a marble
      towards the circle. If both or neither marble stops within the circle
      both players shoot again. If, however, only one playerâ€™s marble stops
      within the circle, that player scores 10 points and goes on shooting,
      scoring 10 points each time his marble stops in the circle. This
      continues until he has scored 100 or until he misses. When he misses the
      turn passes to his opponent who shoots and scores until he misses. The
      first player to reach 100 points is the winner and the loser hands over
      a predetermined number of marbles.

    <h4>Drops (or Dropsies)</h4>
    <p>
      Drops is a marble game that can be played with up to 6 players, and the
      objective of the game is to knock the most marbles out of the ring. To
      prepare the playing field, a ring is drawn with a diameter of roughly 18
      inches. Then, some number of target marbles are placed within that ring,
      preferrably mibs. Players will use their own shooter marble to knock
      marbles out of the ring. However instead of shooting the marbles on the
      ground, marbles are instead dropped from shoulder height down at the
      ring. Players will stand with their toes to the line of the ring, and
      try to knock marbles out of the ring with this method of dropping them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of each player's turn, they must pick up their own marbles
      and then move away from the ring. Then the next player can take their
      turn, standing toes to the line with the ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each marble knocked out of the ring by a player, they are credited
      with one point. When all the marbles within the ring are knocked out,
      points are counted up and the player with the most points is declared
      the winner.
