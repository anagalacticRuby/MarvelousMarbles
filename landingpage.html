    <h2>Marbles: A brief history</h2>
    <p>
      Marbles have been around for countless years, though it isn't exactly
      easy to pinpoint a date and time of 'when' they specifically originated.
      Marbles have been found within the ashes of Pompeii and the tombs of
      ancient Egyptians, but examples of marbles have been seen in Native
      American burial grounds. There have even been reports of marbles being
      found inside ancient Aztec pyramids.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earliest iterations of marbles were simple stones that had been
      abrased until smooth by a running river, with the innate roundness of
      the stones likely making them stand out. Handmade marbles have been
      crafted by artisans for centuries made of materials like clay, stone, or
      glass.
    </p>

    <p>
      Marbles first became mass producible in 1884, where in Akron, Ohio Sam
      Dyke created a wooden block fitted with six grooves, designed to hold
      lumps of clay. A wooden paddle would be rolled over all the clay balls,
      back and forth in order to create up to six marbles at once. The
      simplicity and low cost of the tools allowed for large batches of
      marbles to be swiftly crafted and shipped out. This ease of mass
      production enabled the price of marbles to drop from about one penny
      each to a bag of 30 marbles for the same price.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1915, the mass production of glass marbles began, thanks to a machine
      created by M.F Christensen (who also happened to live in Akron).
      Christensen's machine consisted of a screw conveyer made up of two
      grooved cylinders spun next to each other. A "slug" of molten glass was
      placed between the cylinders on one end and it was gradually carried
      down to the opposite side, simultaneously cooled and shaped shaped into
      a sphere by the rolling grooves. The ingenuity of this machine has stood
      the test of time, and is still the most common way to make marbles
      today.
